<p class = "Question"> What is Quest[x].com? </p><br>
<p class = "answer"> Quest[x] is a forum designed from the ground up with Play-by-Post roleplaying in mind.  </p><br><br>

<p class = "Question">How is this place organized?</p><br>
<p class = "answer"> Quest[x] categorizes topics into four categories, quest threads, fiction, play-by-post roleplaying, and simply generic threads. This categorization simplifies things for quest thread and fiction readers, by allowing them to use the story only button to ignore discussion in favor of updates the author posts.</p><br><br>

<p class = "Question">I have an account, what now? </p><br>
<p class = "answer">If you have an idea for a story/roleplay/quest, start a thread. Otherwise, vote in other peoples threads, join a play by post roleplaying session, or simply discuss things to your hearts content! </p>
<br><br>

<p class = "Question">What is a Quest Thread?</p><br>
<p class = "answer">The quest thread is a form of play-by-post roleplaying where the board of players controls a single entity by voting on its actions, usually one character for standard quests, or an entire organization or country if the quest is an empire builder. </p>
<br><br>

<p class = "Question">What Do the thread colors mean?</p><br>
<p class = "answer">Gray threads aren't related to some matter of creative work. Purple Threads are stories and fanfiction. Red Threads are for conventional roleplaying, such as Dungeons and Dragons/Pathfinder. Green Threads are quest threads. </p>
