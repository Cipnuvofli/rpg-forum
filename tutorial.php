<font size="4" style="margin-left:2em" color="#b19b37">How is this place organized?</font><br>
<font size="3" color="#C0C0C0" style="margin-left:3em"> Quest[x] categorizes topics into four categories, quest threads, fiction, play-by-post roleplaying, and simply generic threads. This categorization simplifies things for quest thread and fiction readers, by allowing them to use the story only button to ignore discussion in favor of updates the author posts.</font><br><br>

<font size="4"style="margin-left:2em" color="#b19b37">I have an account, what now? </font><br>
<font size="3" color="#C0C0C0" style="margin-left:3em">If you have an idea for a story/roleplay/quest, start a thread. Otherwise, vote in other peoples threads, join a play by post roleplaying session, or simply discuss things to your hearts content! </font>

<font size = "4" style="margin-left:2em" color="#b19b37">What is a Quest Thread?</font><br>
<font size="3" color="#C0C0C0" style="margin-left:3em">The quest thread is a form of play-by-post roleplaying where the board of players controls a single entity by voting on its actions, usually one character for standard quests, or an entire organization or country if the quest is an empire builder. </font>
